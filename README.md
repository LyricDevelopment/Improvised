# Improvised
Improvised is WIP box server created by Lyric/Fusezion, the aim of this project is to not only be open sourced but also as a means to showcase what a box server could be.

The drive for creating this project was due to being denied Developer rank on a box server because "they aren't currently looking for any more developers", then proceeded to never update their message about applying to say so. as such I will make a server better than theirs and laugh in their face. <3

You can contact me on the Improvised discord [here]() by creating a ticket if you have any questions.
